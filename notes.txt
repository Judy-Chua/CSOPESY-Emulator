to debug:
change all mem-per-proc kasi sa specs its just min-mem-per-proc and max-mem-per-proc
fix the cpu utilization
not sure if need but added initialization requirement to the other commands
----------------------------------
working code
>did not use BackingStore and FlatMemoryAllocator codes kasi time consuming
 pero inupload ko na rin tho need pa yun ng editing

remember to create "memory" folder sa build kasi dito masostore yung logs

will record this later after class or maybe before

try to debug na rin siguro because i did not debug much

i did not try yung delay = 0 (may error ata logically)
higher delay is goods para makita talaga changes
lower delay is very fast sooooo idk
